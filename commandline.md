# The Command Line
Somewhere around 1969, someone decided to replace the printer on their teletype computer terminal (known as a tty,) with a cathode ray tube, giving birth to the "Glass TTY," perhaps the first truly modern computer interface.
With the Unix kernel came some of the first modern command line interpreters, or "shells." In 1971, Ken Thompson created "sh," also known as the "Thompson Shell."
In 1979, Stephen Bourne created the "Bourne Shell," which was generally replaced with the "Bourne again Shell," or "bash" in 1988.  Bash is still the most commonly-used shell, thirty years later,
