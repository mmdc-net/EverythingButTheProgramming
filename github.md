# Github
(N.B.: You probably want to read through the [Intro to Git](https://github.com/mmdc-net/EverythingButTheProgramming/blob/master/git.md)
 before tackling this one.)

## Downloading projects and files using git
Not sure where to put this section, so I'll put it here.  This is a bit outside what I want to show, but it's important:
Git isn't just for development teams--sometimes you just want to grab a repository from GitHub to use the files contained within.  For example, you can grab the repository that is used to maintain the document you are now reading by using `git clone`
````
    git clone git@github.com:mmdc-net/curriculum.git
````
## Creating an account on GitHub
[Head on over to GitHub](https://github.com/) now and create an account now, if you don't already have one.  It's free, though with a paid account, ($7/mo,) you can create unlimited private repositories.  Just do the free one for now, as you can also create an unlimited number of repos, but they will all be public.
### Your GitHub Name
Choose your name wisely.  Ideally, you'll be creating well-written projects that you'll be proud to show to prospective clients or employers, so you may wind up regretting the name "sk8erboi1996."  Of course, if your tech channel on YouTube has ten million subscribers under that name, go for it!
### Upload your SSH Keys
Create a new key for GitHub, [as directed here:](https://github.com/mmdc-net/EverythingButTheProgramming/blob/master/github-ssh.md)
When you've copied the contents of your github.pub, paste it in here:
[https://github.com/settings/keys/new](https://github.com/settings/keys/new)

## Create Your First repo
Once you are logged in [create a new repo](https://github.com/new) Let's call it "myProject," to coincide with the repo we created in the [Git Module](https://github.com/mmdc-net/EverythingButTheProgramming/blob/master/git.md) of this course.
