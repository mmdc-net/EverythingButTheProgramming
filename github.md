# Github
## Downloading projects and files using git
Git isn't just for development teams--sometimes you just want to grab a repository from GitHub to use the files contained within.  For example, you can grab the repository that is used to maintain the document you are now reading by using `git clone`
````
    git clone git@github.com:mmdc-net/curriculum.git
````
